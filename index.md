# Project 5

[RETURN TO HOMEPAGE](https://sierrabakerr.github.io/)


## Learning Objectives:

### After completing this project, you will:

Gain experience working with classes, including class constructors and methods

Gain experience interpreting existing code to design a new class, including constructor and methods

Gain more experience working with code modules

Gain experience executing and debugging Node.js code using VSCode, including module breakpoints

Gain more experience working with Array map() and forEach() methods

Gain experience working with the concept of a gaming loop

Gain more experience working with objects and arrays


## Overview:

### Project elements:

For this project, you will create a Monster Game program using classes. The game will create monsters with initial life values, and minimum life values for the monster to be alive. Once the game is running, each monster's life will be drained by a random amount, and the game will continue until all of the monsters have died. The game will include a delay before each life drain.

### Important: 
The reason for offering extra credit for this project is to encourage you to examine and understand the code, and to "dig" in to determine how the code works. With this understanding, you'll better be able to meet the coding requirements to receive the extra credit.

### Tip: 
For this project, you are encouraged to set VSCode breakpoints in the module files (e.g. p5-monster.js), even though you'll be starting the execution of the code from p5-js. VSCode will pause on breakpoints in files used by the project.


## Project Deliverables:

### 1. p5.js
[p5.js](p5.js)

### 2. p5-monster-game.js
[p5-monster-game.js](p5-monster-game.js)

### 3. p5-monster.js
[p5-monster.js](p5-monster.js)
